# Refacto service integrations

## Databases

By default, Refacto will use an in-memory database. This means it
cannot be load-balanced, and all data will be erased if the server is
restarted or an update is deployed. To persist data and allow
load-balancing, configure a real database:

### MongoDB

You can specify the database connection string as:

```sh
DB_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/refacto" ./index.js
```

The URL can also contain options, such as:

```sh
DB_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017/refacto?ssl=true" ./index.js
```

#### Installation

On macOS, MongoDB can be installed with:

```sh
brew install mongodb
brew services start mongodb
```

On Ubuntu, it can be installed with:

```sh
apt install mongodb
```

The configuration file will be created at `/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf`
on macOS and `/etc/mongod.conf` on Ubuntu.

_Note: MongoDB's default security model is enough for local
development, but you should lock it down further in deployments. See
the [security documentation](./SECURITY.md) for details._

### Redis

Redis is also supported for persisting data, but is experimental and
not recommended for production deployments.

```sh
DB_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0" ./index.js
```

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is also supported for persisting data, but is not optimised
for this type of data. For small deployments, it may be easier to
securely configure PostgreSQL than MongoDB.

You must create a database for Refacto to use. The schema will be
auto-generated when the app starts.

```sh
DB_URL="postgresql://localhost:5432/refacto" ./index.js
```

## Authentication providers

### Google sign in

You will need a Google client ID:

1. Go to <https://console.developers.google.com/apis>
2. Create a new project (if necessary)
3. In the "Credentials" screen, find the auto-generated OAuth client
   entry (if it was not created automatically, create one manually with
   "Create credentials" &rarr; "OAuth client ID")
4. Record the client ID (you will not need the client secret)
5. Update the authorised JavaScript origins to match your deployment.
   e.g. for local testing, add `http://localhost:5000`
6. Update the authorised redirect URIs to the same value, with
   `/sso/google` appended to the end.
7. You may want to change the "Support email" listed under
   "OAuth consent screen", as this will be visible to users of your
   deployed app.

You can now invoke the application with the `SSO_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
environment variable set. This applies to both local testing and
deployments. For example:

```sh
SSO_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="something.apps.googleusercontent.com" ./index.js
```

### GitHub sign in

You will need a GitHub client ID:

1. Go to <https://github.com/settings/applications/new>
2. Set the "Homepage URL" to match your deployment. e.g. for local
   testing, use `http://localhost:5000`
3. Set the "Authorization callback URL" to the same value, with
   `/sso/github` appended to the end.
4. Record the client ID and client secret.

You can now invoke the application with the `SSO_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and
`SSO_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables set. This applies to
both local testing and deployments. For example:

```sh
SSO_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="idhere" SSO_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET="secrethere" ./index.js
```

### GitLab sign in

You will need a GitLab client ID:

1. Go to <https://gitlab.com/profile/applications>
2. Set the "Redirect URI" to match your deployment with
   `/sso/gitlab` appended to the end. e.g. for local
   testing, this could be `http://localhost:5000/sso/gitlab`
3. Untick the "confidential" option. You do not need to enable
   any scopes.
4. Record the application ID (you will not need the secret).

You can now invoke the application with the `SSO_GITLAB_CLIENT_ID`
environment variable set. This applies to both local testing and
deployments. For example:

```sh
SSO_GITLAB_CLIENT_ID="idhere" ./index.js
```

To use a self-hosted GitLab deployment, you will also need to set
the auth and token info URLs:

```sh
SSO_GITLAB_AUTH_URL="https://gitlab.example.com/oauth/authorize" \
SSO_GITLAB_TOKEN_INFO_URL="https://gitlab.example.com/oauth/token/info" \
SSO_GITLAB_CLIENT_ID="idhere" \
./index.js
```

### Public access

If you are running Refacto in a private network where all users are
trusted, you can set up Refacto to allow all users access to a single
account. This is simpler than setting up an authentication provider,
but will allow everybody access to the same account.

```sh
INSECURE_SHARED_ACCOUNT_ENABLED=true ./index.js
```

By default this will use `/api/open-login` as the login URL. If you
want to use a different URL, you can configure it:

```sh
INSECURE_SHARED_ACCOUNT_ENABLED=true \
INSECURE_SHARED_ACCOUNT_AUTH_URL="/custom-path" \
./index.js
```

You may want to provide some additional security by protecting this
URL in your proxy. For example, to enable Basic auth using NGINX:

```
location /api/open-login {
    auth_basic           "Admin";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/apache2/.htpasswd;
}
```

Or to enable access only from a specific IP:

```
location /api/open-login {
    allow 1.2.3.4/32;
    deny all;
}
```

When using the shared account, any user who can log in will see the
same list of retros (i.e. all of the retros created by any user), and
can access them without a password. If you want to prevent this,
disable the "My Retros" list:

```sh
INSECURE_SHARED_ACCOUNT_ENABLED=true \
PERMIT_MY_RETROS=false \
./index.js
```

## Other Integrations

### Giphy

You will need a Giphy API key:

1. Go to <https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/?create=true>
2. Log in and provide an application name and description
3. Record the API key.

You can now invoke the application with the `GIPHY_API_KEY` environment
variable set. This applies to both local testing and deployments. For example:

```sh
GIPHY_API_KEY="keyhere" ./index.js
```

### haveibeenpwned Password Database

The [haveibeenpwned password database](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords)
is automatically used for checking user-provided passwords (k-Anonymity
ensures no passwords are leaked to the external service).

No configuration is required.

If you wish to _disable_ this integration, you can specify a blank URL:

```sh
PASSWORD_CHECK_BASE_URL="" ./index.js
```

### Logs

Refacto writes logs to `stderr` by default, which will typically be picked up
by the service runner and written to the system logs (e.g. syslog or journal).

You can configure it to write to a file instead:

```sh
LOG_FILE="/path/to/file.log" ./index.js
```

This will direct all structured logs to the file (some unstructured startup and
shutdown logs will still be written to `stderr`). Each log entry is a single
line containing a JSON-encoded object of the form:

```json
{ "time": 1757433145000, "event": "something", "other-fields": "" }
{ "time": 1757433145000, "error": "type", "name": "MyError", "message": "oops", "stack": "this.js:88\nthat.js:100" }
```

When analytics are enabled, client-related log entries will also contain browser
and OS versions (see the [security documentation](./SECURITY.md)).

#### Log rotation

You can use an external service such as `logrotate` to configure logrotation.
After rotating the logs, send a `SIGHUP` to Refacto to make it reopen the log
file (else it will continue to write logs to the renamed file).

```sh
kill -SIGHUP <refacto-pid-here>
```

For example if started as a service via systemd, the following `logrotate`
config will work (adjust paths, user, group, frequency, etc.):

```
/path/to/refacto/logfile.log {
  weekly
  rotate 52
  notifempty
  missingok
  create 640 refacto-user adm

  compress
  delaycompress

  postrotate
    kill -SIGHUP "$(systemctl show --property MainPID --value refacto.service)"
  endscript
}
```
